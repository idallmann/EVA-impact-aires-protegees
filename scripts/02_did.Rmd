# Difference-in-difference

In this script are performed the last steps of the analysis. Using the datasets of matched treated and control units, it is possible to compute the effect of the conservation for each protected area. Then these results can be aggregated at country and region level. 
Some secondary metrics are also computed : the annual deforestation rates faced by treated and control units, before and after treatment (à la Wolf et al. 2021); the total and average forest loss across groups of protected areas on the period considered, compared to the value in control units, before and after matching.

The process consists of the following steps.

1.  For a given country, load the list of protected areas whose observational units (treated pixels composing this area) have been matched to control units.

2.  For each protected area in this list :

    1.  Compute annual deforestation rates : before and after treatment for treated units, on the whole period for control units.

    2.  Compute treatment effect from matched treated and control pixels. Note that two functions exist depending on the portfolio analyzed : for AFD supported protected areas, funding-related information are added to the analysis (e.g year of funding). For the others, a general script is used.

    3.  Compute treatment effect for unmatched treated and control pixels. This can be useful to assess the bias induced by the selection into treatment. In other words, the bias due to not using matching. Indeed protected areas tend to be located in region less prone to deforestation (e.g further away from cities or roads). Simply using non-protected areas as a counterfactual, without matching, would then overestimate the effect of the conservation program. Note that this step can be time and computationally intensive, because the number of unmatched units is higher than the number of matched ones. It is usually skipped.

    4.  Plot the total area deforested on the period considered, in the protected area and its counterfactual, before and after matching. This is useful to illustrate the bias described above. Note that ideally the deforestation estimated in the protected area before and after matching should be the same. If note, the matched treated units are not representative of the overall protected area and the a local treatment effect will be estimated.

    5.  The treatment effects, pre-tests, annual deforestation rates and estimations of total deforested area computed for each protected areas are gathered in specific datasets. This makes it possible to compute metrics aggregated at country and region level. These datasets are saved to the storage, for each country and for all countries.

3.  Assess the quality of matching (for matched control and treated pixels, for matched and unmatched treated pixels) pre-test for all PA. Define non-academic and academic filtering to remove results of some PA potentially.

4.  Assess the loss of observations on the whole data-processing : during pre-processing (due to filtering of PA we cannot analyse, overlap removal): post-processing (typically matching step) and DiD steps.

5.  Results of the analysis at protected area level are aggregated at country and region level.

6.  Finally, figures and tables are created to display the results.

To better understand a function, or identify and debug an error, a good practice is to enter the loops using a single country or PA.

For instance in « 02_matching.Rmd), set value i = « COM » in the first loop and j = 313046 to peform the analysis step by step for PA with WDPA ID 313046 in Comoros.

## Assess the quality of matching and pre-test

The treatment effects are computed using a difference-in-difference framework where control are built from a matching procedure. The treatment effects computed can be biased if (1) matched control and treated units are too different on average; (2) matched and unmatched treated units are too different on average (Schleicher et al., 2020). Also, the estimation from difference-in-difference is biased if parallel trend assumption does not hold, which is likely if control and treated matched unit do no follow the same trend before treatment.

In matching and DiD procedures, we have computed for each PA some statistics to assess the quality of the matching process and the pre-treatment parallel trend assumption. Before plotting and aggregating treatment effects, we first remove a PA if these statistics suggest poor matching of pre-treatment parallel trend.

## Tidy datasets with acceptable quality

The previous section makes it possible to filter PA with acceptable initial forest cover, matching quality and pre-test. Then, it is possible to build a dataset of a subset of PA. For presentations to non-academic, we choose to maximize the number of operations, so we only remove PA with non-acceptable initial forest cover. For academic publications and comunications, we also remove PA with bad matching quality and pre-test.

```{r, eval = F}

## Assess the loss of observations

Some PA can be dropped during the matching and DiD process for several reasons : the PA without overlap can be too small compared to the initial area, no observation unit in a given PA is matched, matching quality is poor, pre-test does not hold. In any communication, it is necessary to be explicit about such losses. In both matching and DiD processes, dataframe are built to report the PAs in the different steps : before and after pre-processing, post-processing and DiD.

### Compute overlap removal

In the matching pre-processing, the PA analysed are removed any overlap with other PA polygon reported in the WDPA. If the overlap is greater than 10% of the initial area of the polygon reported in the WDPA, then the PA is removed from the sample. This operation is necessary to isolate the treatment effect of the PA of interest, not from a mix of different PA. The overlaps are also not considered for control. It is important to quantify the loss of area implied by this operation, and count how many PA are removed from our sample.

```{r, eval = F}

#Initialize a dataset where the area of each PA is reported : area reported in the WDPA, area without any overlap, 
df_pa_overlap = data.frame()
count_i = 0
#For each country in the list of interest
## Import country polygon, find its UTM code
## Import the polygons from the WDPA, except points, and project it following the country UTM code
## Compute the area of polygons reported in the WDAP
## Compute a layer of polygons without overlap, compute the corresponding area, assess whether the PA should be kept or not
## Store the overlaps

  # Numerous polygons reported in the WDPA overlap. This can lead be an issue : a pixel can be treated more than once, and the treatment effect of the PA of interest cannot be isolated a priori 
  # Compute a layer of polygons without overlaps, and with overlaps only. The analysis will be performed on polygons with no overlap and whose non-overlapped area is not too small (10% at least of initial area). Also, the overlapped areas are assigned to a specific group so that they are not used as control.

## Compute aggregated metrics at country and region level

The aggregation of results at country and regional level is not necessarily relevant when the number of protected areas by country or region is relatively small and results heterogenous across protected areas. Instead, a figure displaying the results for all protected areas in the sample might be mor relevant. See next section.

### Average and total forest loss on the period, at country and region level

For each protected area, the total deforestation is estimated on the period in the protected area and a counterfactual, before and after matching. This metric can be aggregated at country and region level : the sum of total deforestation or its average. This can be computed for all protected areas in the sample, a specific subset of protected areas, but also at country or region level.

```{r, eval = F}

#Import datasets
df_plot_forest_loss = aws.s3::s3read_using(
FUN = data.table::fread,
object = paste(save_dir, "df_fl_2000_2021.csv", sep = "/"),
bucket = "projet-afd-eva-ap",
opts = list("region" = ""))


#After non-academic filtering
df_plot_forest_loss_noaca = df_plot_forest_loss %>%
  filter(wdpaid %in% list_pa_fc_2000)

#Call a fcuntion to plot total and average forest loss on the 2000-2021 period, for PA of interest and others
fn_plot_forest_loss_agg(df_plot_forest_loss = df_plot_forest_loss_noaca,
                        alpha = alpha,
                        save_dir = save_dir)

```

## Display treatment effects

## In figures and tables

The treatment effects computed for each protected areas can be displayed in figures or tables. Again, a function is used for protected areas supported by the AFD to include information on funding (funding year for instance), and an other for non-supported ones.

Note some protected areas can be removed from the display, because the matching is not satisfying or pre-treatment trends are too different between treated and control units (thus the matched control risk to be an irrelevant counterfactual). Also, one might want to highlight some protected areas. For instance when comparing a subset of protected areas in a given country to the others (protected areas in Madagascar supported by the AFD versus the others for instance).

### On a map

On a map, we want to plot for each country the polygon of all PA (of interest and others), their estimated treatment effect (5 and 10 years) , their significance. *This step is still under development.*

```{r, eval = F}

#For forest cover, non-academic filtering
df_att_map = df_fc_att_tidy_noaca %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(att_pa, att_pix,  cband_lower_pix, cband_upper_pix, cband_lower_pa, cband_upper_pa, cband_lower_per, cband_upper_per, sig, sig_end, alpha, c, se, n)) %>%
  filter(time %in% c(5, 10))
##Reste à pivoter et ajouter polygone depuis la WDPA avec WDPA_PID. 
```
